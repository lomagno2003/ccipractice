/*
 * One way to use a single array as 3 stacks is to just split it in 3 equal arrays.
 * The problem with this solution is that, in the case that one of the stacks is
 * used more than the others, this will overflow the others, and the others will
 * empty or almost empty.
 * With 2 stacks the problem is easy, one stack is build from the begin of the 
 * array, and the other from the end of the array.
