If p is the probability to make the shot, then the probability of win the first
game is just p. In the other game, the probability of win will be the probability
of miss just one of the shoots plus the probability of make all of them. So if !p
is the probability of miss the shot(!p=1-p), then:
!p*p*p + p*!p*p + p*p*!p + p*p*p = 3(p*p*!p) + p³
then if(p > 3(p*p*!p + p³) then i will choose the first game, else i will choose 
the second one
