 * Well, i can put pills of the bottle in an ascending scale, for example
 * 1 pills of bottle 1,
 * 2 pills of bottle 2,
 * and so on.. so if all the bottles have pills of 1 gram, when i use the measure
 * it should give me 1 + 2 + 3 ... 19 + 20 = 210
 * Now, suppose that one of the bottles have 1.1 gram pills, and suppose is the bottle
 * 7, we have to sum 0.7 grams to the result. Then if the measure give 210.7, then the
 * 7th bottle is the heavy one. If it were the 18th bottle, the sum would give
 * 211.8, now we can find the bottle just doing this:
 * bottleIndex = (sum - 210)*10
 * And thats it
